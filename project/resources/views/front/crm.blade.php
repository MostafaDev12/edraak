                    <h2>CRM - The Strategy</h2>
                    <p>The idea of how businesses approach customer interactions and building relationships with them forms their CRM strategy. It involves collecting customer data and analyzing the history of customer interactions to provide better services and build better relationships with the customers to ultimately drive sales and revenue.</p>
                    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-4">Why do you need a CRM strategy?</h3>
                    <p>Without a proper CRM strategy, your customer information will be all over the place, and it'll be hard to keep track of all the touch points and interactions you've had with particular customers. This leads to a drawn out sales cycle, with a generic and sub-par customer experience.</p>

                    <h2>Building great <br> customer relations</h2>
                    <p>Great customer relationships are based on the consistent and personalized experience offered by your organization, regardless of where a customer is in your sales cycle. This means that every team in your organization, from Marketing to Sales to Support must offer a consistent experience when interacting with a customer.</p>
                    <p>When your business is starting off and you're managing all your customer information on spreadsheets, this may be viable, but not advisable. The amount of time spent on data entry could be better spent bringing in customers and closing deals. This becomes exponentially more complicated when you grow your business and expand your customer base. This is where CRM software comes into play.</p>

                <h2 class="w-100">CRM-The Software</h2>
                <p>The origin of modern CRM systems can be traced back to the late 80s and early 90s, that saw the development of Contact Management Systems (CMS), which then evolved into Sales Force Automation (SFA) technology. As the industry grew, vendors were pushed to provide a broader set of services to cover everything from marketing to presales and support.</p>
                <p>A Customer relationship management software is designed to remove silos in customer information by gathering them in a central place, to provide a 360º view of all your customer data. Details like the customer's name, email, phone number, and communication preferences, as well as interaction and purchase history, can be made available to help your teams reach out to customers for the right reasons and through the right channels.</p>

            <h2>Why your business needs a CRM Software</h2>
            <p class="crm-p">If you're finding it hard to manage sales, marketing, and customer relations, maybe it's time you upgraded to sophisticated, all-inclusive business software. If you're on the fence about adopting a Customer Relationship Management solution, look for these warning signs:</p>
            <div class="owl-carousel owl-theme crm-carousel">
                <div class="item">
                    <h4>Lack of knowledge</h4>
                    <p>If you have sales reps out in the field, it's impossible for them to keep everyone involved updated on the status of a deal, or send out documents like sales orders and invoices</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">
                    <h4>Poor customer satisfaction</h4>
                    <p>Scattered information makes it hard to find patterns and personalize your interactions with customers. This ends with all customers being treated the same—and runs the risk of driving them to your competitors for a better experience.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">
                    <h4>Lack of knowledge</h4>
                    <p>This is a derivative of the first indicator. Due to the absence of a centralized location for your customer data, salespeople will find it impossible to keep track of every detail as your customer base grows.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="item">
                    <h4>Turnover costs time and money</h4>
                    <p>When sales reps leave your company, they take with them the relationships they built with customers. Your company needs to invest time and money into training replacements and getting them up to speed on customer preferences.</p>

                <div class="item">
                    <h4>Communication breakdown</h4>
                    <p>A synergy is required between Marketing, who nurtures the lead, and Sales, who closes the deal. Often this lack of information flow hurts the performance of both teams, as neither is aware of what the other team is doing.</p>

                <div class="item">
                    <h4>Lack of centralization</h4>
                    <p>It's hard to make important decisions when your customer data is spread across your excel sheets, business cards, and notes taken during meetings with the customer. It takes too much time and effort to collate the data and make sense of it.</p>

                    <p>More often than not, the thing that stops businesses from adopting new technology is the fact that teams are uncomfortable with using it.
